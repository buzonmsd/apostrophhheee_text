        I arrived in Geneva on the 1st of September to start this masterâ€™s program and the reading, references, and experiences I have encountered have mainly raised several questions that have much to do with my methodologies, shared work, and my assumption of the curatorial role. I am still in the process of recognizing myself in this context and trying to make sense of my ways of working in recent years in my country. <br>

I have taken the first few months of this 
<a class="melink">academic oasis</a>

style="left: 794px; top: 442px;"> 
to try to understand (in an almost futile task): 

What really sustains a collaborative project between various people? What is the basis of these spaces and models? Why do I insist on working from the perspective of mutualism in art and consider it an act of resistance? What is my role as a curator and artist in the collaborative projects that I have carried out so far and in right now? How do I introduce myself in them? Why do I think it is essential to situate myself from my own experience, feelings, and corporeality? How do I sustain a project based on post-internet and digital practices in Colombia from Geneva? Why do I insist, paradoxically, on maintaining this project, in this avalanche-times of web proposals, in returning to body and affectivity?

These are the questions that, in bits and pieces, make up the concerns of my research, and which, for the moment, also make up my practice. 

To answer them Iâ€™ve been flirting a lot with the importance of presence and, Iâ€™ve been thinking about ways to stay connected with the project I am currently developing with my friend and artist Sebastian Mira in Colombia.
<br>

MSD is a curatorial group whose interests orbit around the virtual and the physical space in installation and sculpture within contemporary artistic practices. We work with themes that are related to hyperlinks, digital crafts, and buffering. We investigate forms of occupation and location both on and off-line, with their respective manifestations and temporalities. The processes that we present as a team inquire about the quality of being present or near within digitality or screen experiences; we seek to address possible definitions and applications of living a moment in the distance or in delay. 
But, in addition to this interest in screen practices and IRL/URL translations, from a shared interest in presence and distance, S and I maintain an affective methodology that translates into an eternal conversation and, in ongoing learning. And when I read about speculative practice and hapticality in the first months of this program, I understood that this conversation could be put in evidence, that a conversation is a redeemable and vital way of exercising political, artistic, and curatorial practice. 
Keeping close to Sebastian, finding excuses and exercises to support our project is a gesture of refusal. It is a minuscule act of resistance, the one I have at my disposal, in these circumstances.
<br>
So we decided to do this website, which opens with our first exercise of closeness. And, with this potentially always mutable platform, we intend together to gather the advances of my/our research and the exercises that we will be doing to remain connected, to think together, to include ourselves in each other's processes, while I am away. The intention is that little by little, we will invite other interlocutors who will join our exercises. Eventually, hopefully, this project will also be translated into IRL.  

(I feel, and I reiterate, I feel, that Yo Nakajima's work (which we found a few months ago with Sebastian), the exercise you have just seen (that we did in these last months while I was acclimatizing to a new life in Switzerland during a pandemic), and this www. project, are an entry point to address, at least tangentially, my questions.) PUNTO DE PARTIDA.

We intend to emphasize the importance of presence (touch), and friendship, and hapticality, and affectivity, and bonds, and commitment to the people you work with. We are trying to insist on the construction of curatorial or community projects that allow confrontation and affectivities; conversations or critical models of understanding and coexistence that build solidary relationships outside the institutions (artistic, academic, or governmental). 

For me, it is presence and affinity what allows us to think of curatorial practices that give space to artistic projects that are not in line with the interests of a fascist government, or a commercial cultural sector, or an institutional apparatus. I believe that when you curate and work from the point of view of presence, autonomy, affection, care, a horizontal will, and an embodied criticality, you start to develop projects that can cope with everything. To Duque's extractivist and exotic policies and to an absolutely impoverished Colombian art sector, for example. 

Added to this presence, other layers have to do with the interests I already carry out as an artist, as a curator, as a woman, as a migrant body, as a nostalgic human being, and the theories, texts, and references that in the last months have strengthened these facets. I am interested in thinking, theorizing, and composing from self-reflectivity, from my corporeality, from my affects, and from my feelings. This is a political position and one that is crucial for understanding the methodologies I use when thinking about curatorial practices. My inquiries and my research are deeply anchored to my context, to the urgency of my context, and my urgencies as an individual. And therefore, my research project is deeply rooted in me, in the experiences I have gathered over the years as an independent curator and as an artist, and in what I am living now.

This attachment to presence is evidently rooted in the inability to be physically close to my country, my own projects, and my own affections. I am currently living a fragmented presence. Recognizing myself, translating myself, and adapting to a new context in which I am starting this master during a pandemic crisis (and therefore unable to have a relationship with a Swiss cultural sector or even with my colleagues), has generated in me the willingness/need to stay connected to the organic and affective practices that have allowed a lot of complicities in my process. 
This is where my relationship with SebastiÃ¡n and the project and friendship we have developed together over the last two and a half years comes in. It is at this point that I come to the "apostrophe" ("a silent, affectively present but physically displaced interlocutor"), that I come to the conversation with him to understand the foundations of our project and our curatorial practice (which I feel should be the basis of any collaborative project). To enunciate, also, the fear we both feel for the imminent loss of touch and closeness (our own and the general). 
<br>

And so, presence is a vehicle or an umbrella word that allows me to talk about these remnants that make up my practice, and that for the moment make up this research. 

We start with these hands, which with a gesture of nothing, allude to a lot.
