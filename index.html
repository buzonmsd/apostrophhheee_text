        I arrived in Geneva on the 1st of September to start this master’s program and the reading, references, and experiences I have encountered have mainly raised several questions that have much to do with my methodologies, shared work, and my assumption of the curatorial role. I am still in the process of recognizing myself in this context and trying to make sense of my ways of working in recent years in my country. <br>

{This website opens with our first exercise of closeness. With this potentially always mutable platform, we intend to gather the advances of my/our research and the exercises that we will be doing to remain connected, think together, and include ourselves in each other's processes while I am away. The intention is that little by little, we will invite other interlocutors who will join our exercises. Eventually, hopefully, this project will also be translated into IRL.}

I arrived in Geneva on the 1st of September to start this master’s program. The readings, references, and experiences I have encountered have raised several questions that have much to do with my methodologies, shared work, and my assumption of the curatorial role. I am still in the process of recognizing myself in this context and trying to make sense of my ways of working in recent years in my country. In an almost futile task, I have taken the first few months of this academic oasis to try to situate myself in my practice.
<br><br>
I feel the exercise you have just seen (that resume these last months while I was acclimatizing to a new life in Switzerland during a pandemic) and this www. project are entry points to address, at least tangentially, my questions. 
<br><br>
What sustains a collaborative project? Why do I insist on working from the perspective of mutualism in art and consider it an act of resistance? What is my role as a curator and artist in the collaborative projects that I have carried out so far and in right now? How do I introduce myself in them? Why do I think it is essential to situate myself from my own experience, feelings, and corporeality? How do I sustain a project based on post-internet and digital practices in Colombia from Geneva? Why do I insist, paradoxically, on maintaining this project, in this avalanche-times of web proposals, in returning to the body and affect?
<br><br>
To answer them, I’ve been flirting a lot with the importance of presence. I’ve been thinking about ways to stay connected with the project I am currently developing with my friend and artist Sebastian Mira in Colombia. Presence is a vehicle or an umbrella word that allows me to talk about the remnants that make up my practice. 
<br><br>
MSD is a curatorial group whose interests orbit around the virtual and the physical space in installation and sculpture within contemporary artistic practices. We work with themes that are related to hyperlinks, digital crafts, and buffering. We investigate forms of occupation and location both on and off-line, with their respective manifestations and temporalities. The processes that we present as a team inquire about the quality of being present or near within digitality or screen experiences; we seek to address possible definitions and applications of living a moment in the distance or delay. 
But, in addition to this interest in screen practices and IRL/URL translations, from a shared interest in presence and distance, S and I maintain an affective methodology that translates into an eternal conversation and, in ongoing learning. And when I read about speculative practices and hapticality in the first months of this program, I understood that this conversation could be put in evidence, that a conversation is a redeemable and vital way of exercising political, artistic, and curatorial practice. 
Keeping close to Sebastian, finding excuses and exercises to support our project is a gesture of refusal. It is a minuscule act of resistance, the one I have at my disposal, in these circumstances. 
<br><br>


We intend to emphasize the importance of presence, touch, friendship, and hapticality, affectivity, bonds, and commitment to the people you work with. We are trying to insist on the construction of curatorial or community projects that allow confrontation and affectivities, conversations, or critical models of understanding and coexistence that build solidary relationships outside the institutions (artistic, academic, or governmental). 
For me, it is presence and affinity that allows us to think of curatorial practices that give space to artistic projects that are not in line with the interests of a fascist government, or a commercial, cultural sector, or an institutional apparatus. I believe that when you curate and work from the point of view of presence, autonomy, affection, care, a horizontal will, and an embodied criticality, you start to develop projects that can tackle everything. 
<br><br>
Other layers of this project and research have to do with the interests I already carry out as an artist, as a curator, as a woman, as a migrant body, as a nostalgic human being, and the theories, texts, and references in the last months have strengthened these facets. I am interested in thinking, theorizing, and composing from self-reflexivity, my corporeality, my affects, and my feelings. This situatedness shows a crucial political position for understanding the methodologies I use when thinking about curatorial practices. My inquiries and my research are embedded in my context, to the urgency of my context, and my urgencies as an individual. And therefore, my research project is deeply rooted in me, in the experiences I have gathered over the years as an independent curator and as an artist, and in what I am living.
<br><br>

This attachment to presence is rooted in the inability to be physically close to my country, my projects, and mis sentires. I am currently living a fragmented presence. Recognizing myself, translating myself, and adapting to a new context in which I am starting this master during a pandemic crisis (and therefore unable to have a relationship with a Swiss cultural sector or even with my colleagues), has generated in me the willingness/need to stay connected to the organic and affective practices that have allowed a lot of complicities in my process. Particularly, the relationship with Sebastián and the project and the friendship we have formed together over the last two and a half years. 
It is at this point that I come to the apostrophe, that I come to the conversation with him to understand the foundations of our project and our curatorial practice (which I feel should be the basis of any collaborative project). To enunciate, also, the fear we both feel for the imminent loss of touch and closeness (our own and the general). 
<br><br>
Entonces, empezamos con estas manos, que con un gesto de nada, lo dicen todo.
